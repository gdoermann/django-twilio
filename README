This library depends on the Twilio library at: https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python/

1. Add twil to your python path and INSTALLED_APPS
2. Add the following variables to your settings.py file:

    DEFAULT_ACCOUNT = "Your Default Twilio Account SID"
    TWILIO_SETTINGS = {
       "Account SID":{
            'api' : '2010-04-01',
            'caller_id' : '123-456-7890',
            'number' : '123-456-7890',
            'sandbox_number' : '1234567890',
            'token' : 'Your Token',
          }
       # Add as many accounts as you have
    }
NOTE: You can set as many accounts as you like (and you can set which account to pull from as well).  

3. To pull your full history into the database run:
    ./manage.py shell
    from twil import models
    models.Sms.objects.pull()

I don't currently have support for conversations or voice stuff.  
I am also working on support for callback urls.

Feel free to contribute!
